Text summarization is the process of creating a shorter version of a document
while preserving its key information and overall meaning.

There are two main types of text summarization: extractive and abstractive.
Extractive summarization selects important sentences directly from the text.
Abstractive summarization generates new sentences that paraphrase the content.

Extractive methods are easier to implement and more interpretable.
Common extractive techniques include frequency-based methods, clustering-based methods,
and graph-based approaches such as TextRank.

Abstractive summarization uses deep learning models such as sequence-to-sequence models
and large language models.
These methods can generate more natural summaries but are harder to control.

Evaluation of summarization systems often uses metrics like ROUGE scores.
Summarization is widely used in search engines, chatbots, news platforms,
and research assistants.
